Hey papa primate.<br>
<br>
Once again you forgot the passcode to the secret file?<br>
<br>
Well this is why we have a back up protocol.<br>
<br>
So this is a quite complex protocol, safety and bla bla.<br>
<br>
Ok, so first, you must understand WHERE the puzzle is taking place.<br>
You can do so in the hint_where_puzzle.txt file.<br>
<br>
Then, you'll need to a 4 digit code, where the puzzle takes place.<br>
<br>
Note:<br>
	If you've figured out where the puzzle takes place<br>
	you could just look everywhere at the place and find<br>
	all the digits.<br>
	But damn, that place is big...<br>
<br>
	So lets be smart and solve the puzzles!<br>
<br>
How?<br>
Well my big brain monkey friend, We read JAVA CODE!<br>
Yeah I know, you got excited.<br>
<br>
The Main.java code has 4 function, called from the main method.<br>
<br>
Run the code in your head,<br>
and after each function call<br>
figure are the Row and Column variable value! (yes this was a big hint).<br>
<br>
Good luck coding!<br>
